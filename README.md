# ScreenSearch
A web application that allows users to search movies, TV shows, and the people that make it all possible.

Check it out at https://sheltered-citadel-85061.herokuapp.com/ (May need to wait a short period of time for Heroku dynos to restart)


## Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, and Sass
- JavaScript ES6
- React.js
- Node.js and Express
- Heroku for deployment

## What I've Learned
This project taught me A LOT about front-end development and building webpages capable of dynamically displaying information.
Here are just some of the things I learned:
- Design and Layout using CSS and Sass
- Responsive and mobile-friendly design using Media Queries
- Creating React components and handling information using props and state
- Making requests using Axios to the TMDB API
- Creating dynamic content - presenting different information for movies as opposed to celebrities, scrollable galleries for posters or photos

## Acknowledgements
